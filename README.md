Here is a list of the tools I used to build this application. Each played an important role in bringing the project together, through structuring and styling the webpages to adding interactivity and functionality with JavaScript. Node.js was used to create a custom server for hosting and handling user requests, allowing the site to run dynamically and efficiently.Through the use of these tools altogether, it enabled me to develop a responsive, user-friendly website that showcases both design and technical elements.
